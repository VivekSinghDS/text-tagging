I loved The Poppy War, but this book... It was the book of my dreams. This Chinese inspired Military Fantasy has my heart.

I don't want to discuss the plot points, because they will be major spoilers if you haven't read the book.

The one thing I learned from reading the Dragon Republic is Men will disappoint you.

This book also showed me how bad things don't only happen in the battlefield. Humans are capable of horrible and evil things, and they don't need a war as an excuse. Heinous acts can be committed in the safest of cities and places. Not to get into spoilers, but every scene with Petra has made me think whether I have ever felt such deeply uncomfortable about a character. The answer is no, and it is a testament to this story.

I think this is a once in a lifetime series. A young, Asian girl putting these old, racist, white, cis men to shame. All the characters are beautifully flawed, raw and so engrossing that I forgot they only live in the pages.

I am so excited to read The Burning God. The Phoenix is consuming me to finish this series asap.

Special thanks to Archita (@literature_and_wanderlust ) for introducing me to this Trilogy. I hadn't even heard of it before you sent the readalong details. And I'm grateful that you did.
