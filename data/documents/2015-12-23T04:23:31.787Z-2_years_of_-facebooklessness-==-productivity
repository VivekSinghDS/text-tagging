2_years_of_ facebooklessness == productivity“why are you not using facebook anymore ?”PastMy friends used to tell me the same thing over and
over and yes, I kept blowing those words away like a wind ofshit. Yes, I was a facebook’s active user : not because it gave me some
serious#moneyor job or some kinds of awesome stuffs that only I had access to; but I wasADDICTEDto.The thing is, I had developed an OCD
(Obsessive Compulsive Disorder) of polling the my facebook timeline in an interval; willing to sacrifice some of my important tasks just to
do stuffs like trolling, status (ing) , commenting, debating in various groups (most of them were physics and mathematics).My whole internet
session used to be just those kinds of facebook shit. In a nutshell, my daily routine was like those straight lines you could never draw
straight :wake up (along with some washroom shit)open facebookstart doing the usual tasks I mentioned earlier (of course there used to be
some important notifications from our college’s group)goto collegereturn homedo (2) and (3)goto bed around mid nightYes, the most important
disorder I had developed was the#unhealthy(i call it unhealthy because i call it:D)sleep cycleI had. Going to bed around mid night and
waking up rarely by alarm clock during late morning was my worst habit I was addicted to. (even those freaking alarm is a no brainer for the
urge to sleep, sleep and sleep).Most of the time in college during those past years, I couldn’t feel quite refreshing because those sleep
inducing hormones/enzymes (whatever you may call) were persistent and I couldn’t even think which I thought I was thinking.:PHence, my
productivity fell exponentially (although never quite reaching theasymptoteof my mind). And then there was me saying:I quit this shit(well
in usual Nepali)Two Freaking YearsAnd, so there was me without facebook and the things i used to do. And, I made my mind clear that I would
use my time in internet solely to raise my productivity. (clear as a crystal in a sand)Let me make you clear that my productivity level had
decreased drastically because my research habits, coding time, problem solving, all went toNULL. I couldn’t even code properly because of
symbiotic relation I had withlaziness.In class/college, some of the pro guyz used to talk about latest problems in optmization, graph
theory, algorithms, technology,etc (on which I had deep interest but had zero information).Although, I had been keeping up with my study
onQuantum Physics.And there was me not giving a damn on college usual notifications like labs, assignments, etc.First thing’s firstRedditis
what made me the person I am today. Every hours of internet I spent onwards was browsing through the subreddits on which I had interest
likeprogramming,python,algorithm,android,technology,quantum physics,artificial intelligence,data science,some embedded system,
science,etc.Most of the time I was (am) passive in reddit because I developed a habit of reading some great articles and stuffs on the
things I mentioned earlier. Honestly, I didnt even skip the portion of those articles. I had my mind on understanding algorithms for solving
certain problems. Various articles fromhackernewsredditstackoverflowtechcrunchmashablegoogle blogsome python blogandroid authoritymade my
hours quite productive. I used to do timepass problem-solving coding shit and quite grew into that. Although, I am still a#nooband still
lack major understanding on many things.Hey! At least I grew productive. And I can whine about it.Some of the subreddits (/r/) I would like
to share (in just some pseudo random order from my python script, or may not be :P)
are:programmingpythonlearnpythonandroidInternetIsBeautifulmathartificialAskScienceAskRedditcoolgithubprojectsdocumentaries (yup I am a
documentary guy)unixporngoogletodayilearneddataisbeautifulcreativecodingquantumI am ayoutubewatcher too (I don’t know what you call a person
that is addicted to youtube). Various, channels I have subscribed to (some I had discovered, some I had seen from articles I read) are
awesome and post great stuffs.Some of the channels, not in particular order

(PHD Comics)The Film TheoristsWatchmojoHow Stuff WorksThere are many in my list which I would like to share, but on reaching this line, you
are probably bored now. Well, what can be done. You might have thought you could get productive by just reading this article. All you need
is an #urge to quit some stuffs you are addicted that is dragging you down.Twitter FeedsBy this time, you are reading this line, you are
probably seeing too much of #hashtags (now this is quite calming meta :P) . Well, that is due to more productive time in twitter. It’s
surprising that how two social networking platformsTwitterandFacebookare way different. From, the very day I started to be official on
twitter I had quite grown productive. This may be due to those 140 characters limit in tweets which makes people think more on the precise
amount of information to put into a single#tweet.Just as I have subscribed to various subreddits and youtube channels, I have followed those
people in twitter too. I get great stuffs in my twitter feeds that I like to read when I wake up early in the morning. There are awesome
people in twitter who are active and inspiring.I have developed a habit of sharing links i.e. I am a #Shareaholic.I don’t care if the links
I share is read (at least opened by others), but I am sure I don’t spam and troll now.MediationAbove all, a good old meditation is one of
the deadliest medicine you can get. Just listen to pulsating low frequency (bass notes) that can resonate with your brain waves. There are
many platforms, on which you can listen to calm sounds (make sure you plug in your headphone,earphone, or any phone :D)Final battleNow, we
are at the end of a journey (that might be just a poop for nothing, because honestly I don’t even deserve wonderful readers that wished to
get something out of this article, but in vain).Facebook’s use is good for certain time in your usual daily works. But, developing a deep
intertwined addiction is a serious sign of some crazy psychological, biological, physical, and whatever breakdown you might get.Yes, too
much of twitter may be bad. But twitter’s sole purpose of providing straightforward information is what wins in a battle
ofTwittervsFacebook.Final Showdown, perhapsInstead of being an anti-social workhorse just do these:go outsidewatch skyhave discussions with
friendstake pictures of those flowers you have in your home using your smartphonejust sit on the roof, under the sun and relaxdo
meditationbe social (i had always been an anti-social guy, but I am improving on my social behaviour)watch great movieswatch documentariesat
least make habit of doing some timepass coding/programming stuffs. This way, you can greatly improve your skills on programming (if you do
one)and ...At the time of writing this article, I (am/was) in final year of my B.E. Computer Engineering stuffs. Since, I had 2 years of
voidness in my social life due to the lack of comprehension for facebook, I am again starting to use facebook with my new account. And this
time it is quite different.I am not the person I used to be.Now, my perception is quite different on social platforms. With true information
sharing platform comes a great change.Afterall,change is inevitable
