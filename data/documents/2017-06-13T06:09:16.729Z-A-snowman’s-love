A snowman’s loveShe held the dirt in a cold-warm winter. The snow spurt and kissed her hair.The white, glowing blanket laughed as she
gracefully leapt around with her cold bare feet; yet heart full of warmth. And a smile full of mystery.It’s a snowman’s love that’ll melt
but heart shall not. It’s a pure colorless love that’ll paint but brush shall not. It’s a sunny love-light but shall shine not.Without any
gloves, she collected the white gold on the ground. The gold, mere a symbolic manifestation of tears from the clouds. She was shivering, not
with cold but with mere joy of freedom to wander outside. The white gold, the snow — she rolled them part by part to give life to a
lifeless. As she gathered the white gold piece by piece, she didn’t know she was giving life to a lifeless.The little mighty trees thriving
with joy of their nakedness, kept on smiling on the sight not too far. Towards them, she jumped like a rabbit — a white rabbit that’s
camouflaged, hiding in plain sight from predators. The twigs — the means to give the lifeless snowman a hand. The means to wipe the tears
off her face.Piece by piece, she was gathering her happiness, her joyful emotions. She was flying on the ground. Her flight had no bounds.
Her empty imaginations filled with colorful dreams.Alas! Time for giving the lifeless the windows to the soul —The EyesThere were no eyes
around. Neither she had any.She kept leaping with imaginations. Searching for pebbles, small stones to create the eyes for the snowman. At
last, ‘twas a one. She held the pebble delicately, putting the pebble onto the face of the snowman. The moment of truth. The moment of
happiness.She could see the snowman. Her blindness could shine a light to the snowman.Finally, the snowman was alive.Piece by piece, she had
given life to a lifeless — like an alchemist trying to bring back something that s/he lost in the past.Her love, her happiness — It’s a
snowman’s love.
