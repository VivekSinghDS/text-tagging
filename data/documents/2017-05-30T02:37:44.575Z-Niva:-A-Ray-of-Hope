Niva: A Ray of HopeAll I can do is watch and sitDunno where I’m going, what it’ll beAs if the wickedness insideHas the audacity to defy
itWhere souls wait to be bleached.And all I can do is,Just watch and sit. Here I am, sitting and watchingAs I peek into the time ticking.All
that is gone has never beenAll that has gone is never seenAnd the plot is on with this humAnd I know I will be gone..... As the time is
eating meWith veins full of miseryLife is crawling with mystery.As I am just sitting and thinkingWith hopes contemplatingI am seeing a
streak.A ray flashing at meBehind these closed doorsWhere I am locked up. Here I am, with my blurred visionA narrow path is emergingLike an
incisionMaking it’s way through.And clearer is the clueI see it. A miracle. A ray.I am begging it to stayFor the darkness seemed
eternityWhere my time had lost its sanityBut now. I see it. A hope. A ray.The ray is crawling on my mindFor it’s the only one of its kind I
remember now. The ray.It’s the ray that sparks a fireWith hope emerging on a thin wireYes! Now I remember!The narrow streak that never
ends.Yes! Now I remember. The ray.It used to be my friend.A hope in my mindWe used to blendFor I gave it a name.NivaNiva. OhNivaFinally, you
are hereNiva. OhNivaHere you are, returning from the starsInside a locked doorsTrying to make meaning of these void scars.
