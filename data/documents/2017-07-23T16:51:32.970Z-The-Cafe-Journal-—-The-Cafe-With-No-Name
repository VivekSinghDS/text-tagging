The Cafe Journal — The Cafe With No Name21 July, 2017, FridayCourtesy of nishparadox — The Boy With No Name :PPreludeAs usual, we guys — me,
Bijay and Mahendra thought of spending some time after office — to chill, to have caffeine, talk about work, life, love and shit.This time,
the purpose was not coffee. So we headed to Thamel.** coughs **The guys had t-shirts to buy from a shop in Thamel. Trust me, the price for
each t-shirt is cheap in that shop. However I didn’t buy because I had bought one few days back along with a new bag.InterludeAfter buying
t-shirt, Bijay had a name of the cafe where we could go for chilling, for solitude —The Cafe With No Name.He had read about the cafe in a
blog. We did laugh on hearing upon the name. I had the Game of Thrones reference in my mind.So, we headed out. Suddenly in the middle of
chaos of Thamel, we were having trouble in locating the cafe just as the saying goes:“so near, yet so far”.Wrong alley, hopes lost, nights
rising. How worse can it get?PostludeThe cafe is located inside a small alleyway. The entrance of the alley has a small board hidden in the
plain sight.The environment inside the cafe is surreal. You can chill for solitude. The jazz or soft rock music in the background makes it
more relaxing. The place is good for dating too.** coughs **The place is small inside but quite comfortable. That might be due to isolation
of outside noise.What’s so special ?It is a non-profit cafeRun by volunteerAll the profit goes to street childrenEvery Wednesday after 7 pm
you can actually give your live performance. Be it singing, guitar, etc. It’ll be good for attraction for a non-profit cafe like this.The
cafe also has a book shelf. So a plus point for readers.FoodWe had Paninis which is a type of sandwich. We had tuna as well as cheese
Panini. It was delicious but low on quantity, the deliciousness of which can never fill the stomach. The tuna Panini was awesome.Along with
the set of Panini, we were given a choice to choose any kind of drinks — Americano, latte, cold drinks, lassi,** insert caffeine powered
drinks here **We had cappuccino.The cappuccino was average. I am a caffeine addict and that cappuccino was too thin. Nevertheless, I got to
have it with Panini.PriceWell, the bill turned out to be Rs 1100. We were shocked.1 tuna panini1 cheese panin3 cappuccinoI don’t know how
it’s plausible for something so less in quantity to cost that much. But I guess we can’t regret and neither we can argue for the cause that
the money goes to.My thoughtsOther than the price and the quantity of the food and the limitation of food varieties, the cafe is a chilling
place. The vibes of jazz and the soft-rock in the background along with low light gives you a mood of solitude, a sense of privacy.You
should have patience while waiting for the food that’s being ordered because most of the time the food is prepared by a single human (I’d
say a superhuman. Cheers to him — the manager I suppose).Someday, I am hoping to give an acoustic live performance there. Till then, a nice
place to just be yourself without any outside and irrelevant noise.Oh yes. I am hoping that this small non-profit cafe to gain more traction
because your money and your time spent won’t be wasted.
