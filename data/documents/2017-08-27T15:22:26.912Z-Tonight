Tonight Tonight! I am not sad.Nor I am mad.I am expressionless.There’s nothing I have to express.There’s no desire at expense. Tonight! I am
a commoner.A Son — whose heart beats for his mother.A Child — dreams all stoutA Brother — sister’s hopes echo aloudA Neighbour — lively yet
mysteriousA Citizen — responsible, ingloriousA no one — lurking in the shadow Tonight! I am a friendA faceless in the circleIndependent —
lost in thoughtsOf love, life and artsSome reasons to liveNone clinging to another’s dream Tonight! I am a pedestrianWandering around,
feeling the rainA Walker — indifferent yet significantA Watcher —looking beyond the blurred lensA Thinker — lost in dreamsOf silence and
screams.A Painter — filling the imaginationWith life and thoughtsStill, I am no one rushing around. Tonight — It’s special.I’m on a date —
with Peace and ChaosNo emotions — I am expressionlessTonight! I am in search of myself.A someone — a face under the maskA traveller through
timeA wanderer through life.A stargazer — in awe of vastnessOf life and emptiness.
