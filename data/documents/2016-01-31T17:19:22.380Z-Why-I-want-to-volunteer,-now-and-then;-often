Why I want to volunteer, now and then; oftenIn my whole life, I’ve never quite shown any interest on offering help to do some great and
awesome things; be it those volunteering stuffs insomethingor some programmes that friends organized for some types of awareness, creativity
and productivity enhancement. I had always been hiding under the shadows and never quite grew on such miraculous concepts like volunteering.
I had always thought that those stuffs were just physically-dragging events in space-time continuum.One of the reasons might be myshynature
and I didn’t feel like getting rid of those shyness.Another reason might be my fear of facing the crowds, because I had always felt like
messing up the things I would do. This might be the most darkness driven philosophy of mine (and this is the reason people call me a
pessimist). Facing your own friends and closest people is enchanting, But, hey come on! Facing those unknown faces hiding under the mask is
like those nightmares in the darkness you used to get during childhood, hoping your parents would bring a brighter light.Final reason is I
can’t really talk togirls. This is such a let down and a no brainer for me. I haven’t quite gotten used to talking to girls because of fear
and shyness despite the fact that girls in schools and colleges in the past used to respect me for who I was/am.Let me make it clear; I am a
very helpful person (as people and friends around me say ). But I help on the things I like like programming, mathematics, physics,
technology and such. But the downside is I am highly addicted to non-impulsive tasks that don’t demand much of physical workout. This is the
very hole in my life, cuz I never really tried to fill the gap.Perhaps, I never did try to get rid of the fear I have. And now, since I am
trying to change my habits and personality in such stuffs, I really want to volunteer.Why volunteer, you ask?I would say, I want to because
I want to meet new people, I want to stab my heart from the shadows I was hiding, remove the shyness inside me and get hold of new faces. I
want to meet new people, why you ask? Because I want to get to know the world outside of my realm. I want to meet awesome people.I want to
be inspired. I want to learn, I want to inspire. I want to help. I want to read people, understand them, emotions and feelings. Above all, I
want to learn by helping others, because people teach people. I want to help with all I can with my skills and knowledge I have accumulated
these past years. That’s all.I used to think that people volunteer just to get experience. But now I am getting that this is just a quarter
part of the story. I get it that people will need experience greatly in their life to get the things right (notcorrect). But above all there
will always be the joy of helping others.Ok! I want to learn things, But above all I want to get rid of my shyness and fear of facing the
crowd and I want to get rid of my fear to talking to girls.First StepI have recently volunteered forCAN Info Tech 2016. I wanted to
volunteer forFOSSand finally did. Acted like a “coordinator” (hmm, such a great post heh?) for the stall of FOSS-Nepal but never quite acted
like coordinator. I was there to face people, to make them realize the awesomeness of truefreedomusing the magical spell of free and open
source software.I was quite surprised on seeing the number of people literally rising exponentially every hour on our stall; that people did
have enthusiasm on open source platforms like GNU/Linux, wikipedia (especially the Wikipedia). I am astonished that people really wanted to
get into nepali wikipedia because they were truly interested on sharing knowledge. About 75% did show interest on wikipedia.The reason I
volunteered to such is I wanted to share the truefreedomof user; clear various misconceptions and persuade people towards using free and
open source platforms. And I think I did quite achieve something here. There were people (4–5, perhaps) that really appreciated me because I
helped them learn of new things, concept of user liberation, doing whatever one wants for their own benefit and above all freelysharewhat
they have/learn.Well, people taking a photo with me did prove well for my good interaction. I helped people clear some general
misconceptions like security during transparent system, one-click hacking stuffs (because there isn’t a short path to this). Some people
were literally asking for a trial version of GNU/Linux but I cleared this misconception too.I didn’t hesitate to talk with girls too because
I was willing to share the information on FOSS truly and yes I didfeeling achieved though :D :PThere were people who were interested in
programming in their business life. And I am happy that I am a programmer and did gave them information on this (especially on data
statistics and processing stuffs with R and python).Also, not to forget other awesome volunteers. They were truly marvellous (and are).And
now I am feeling like I have accomplished something.That’s a giant leap for me ( in your face, Watney fromThe Martian 2015:P )
