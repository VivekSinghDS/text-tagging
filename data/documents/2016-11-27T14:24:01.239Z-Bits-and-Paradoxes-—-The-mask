Bits and Paradoxes — The mask Life is an abstractionAs I have been saying life is too much of a**complex**entity. Life is**abstract**.In
programming, the wordabstractionimplies:hiding the complex operations by the use of simpler interfaces that anyone can access without having
to know about the underlying complexity.Abstract in a sense, you do not expose every bits of you to the outer world. The world only knows
what you intend to present yourself:an introvert, jerk, nerd, humourous, serious shit, knows-it-all or a knows-nothing, musician, worrier or
warrier, serializer or parallelizer, dreamer or drummer, crier or carer.Be it anything what you show. You are what you are truely inside.An
introvertmight be known for shyness. But does the world really know the level of mischief s/he’s been doing to the close ones?A
musicianmight be **popular-kid-in-town**. But, does the world really know the level of plagiarism s/he’s been involved in ?A dreamer: Does
the world really know what illusions s/he has been creating or perhaps living in?The face that you show to the outer world doesn’t quite
represent the exact stuffs that happen inside your mind truely.You are really what you hide inside that mask.And the mask is really the
remnant of what you are trying to cover up.This is the exact case that has been happening to the juniors/seniors studying engineering. ( I
am referencingengineering, especially “Programming shit”, because unfortunately I am a pending engineer headed into extincion, perhaps).From
the very beginning (start of the first year) to the end of the final year, we are always mounting that verymaskthat has been creating the
illusion of “all is well! all is well”. People tend to be more ignorant than they actually think they are. Especially on the habits,
behaviours and such.Ok! Here’s the catch.In the beginning, you know nothing.This has a positive effect on the mindset for learning surreal
stuffs. New energy, new enthusiasm and never-ending target of new things. You get involved into friends; the friends don’t give a shit. You
get invovled into social vicinity; you become fuzzy yet strong. The fuzzier you are, the more you are creating the mask.As days pass by, you
evolve with greater good; be it the technical, philosophical, psychological, biological or any evil mindset. Eventually, you live in a
bounded sphere where you are revolving with daily procrastination. And that instant gratification monkey changes the trajectory of your
learning curve. Finally, you don’t even bother for such “learning” stuff and go on becoming chill. This is the very truth for all the young
minds on which the world itself is being mounted for better future.Hence, the real mask gets stuck on your face real hard this time. You
forget what you had intended to do, what you wanted to achieve and what you wanted to influence. And you expose something that doesn’t
really show who you really are. The abstraction is real, so is that mask.So! What’s the catch actually?Never let yourself go fuzzyFind your
true passion and interest and channel your optimal (yet leisure) time to solely build upon that passion. That’s the only way you can improve
over certain things. It doesn’t have to be “one giant leap for mankind”. Even a 5-minutes “Today I learned” can make a difference,
especially when you are into programming and such.Time allocation is hard I knowWe all have that phase in life where we have nothing to do;
yet we don’t have free time. And that’s the actual catch here.Procrastination is a real sucker and beating it in its own game is
paranoid.So, how can we really improve so that we can unmask ourself bit by bit?Start small. Bigger events unfold through small tidbits. For
example, looking up asubredditonce in a while (doesnt have to be too long) or reading some answers inquoramight be a good kickstarter.And if
you feel lazy in doing that, relax.We are all no-brainers. You have someone in your chat list who can really inspire you to learn stuffs.
(Dog knows what, s/he really cares about you, perhaps.) Asking about the things you find difficult to grasp can really clear your confusion
on the topics.You expose your true self by asking questions.If that’s a drag, just don’t fret about it.Take a nap.Reboot your mind for a
fresh start for the formal actions mentioned.And, don’t forget to attain seminars and meetups for self-improvement. Interaction with people
might boost your confidence at some level. Yes, I know being anintrovertis a let down. But, hey! At least we can give it a try.Still we
learn nothing Yes, the chart about a semester. It is so meta. This is the very reason procrastination is a game changer in each semester
you(will/have) attain(ed). Not because it helps but it deforms the very force that’s gluing your mind and the ability to learn.The real
culpritBy now, you might have been totally infiltrated by the total chaosness of this article itself. And trust me, you’ve even scrolled
some of other sites parallely like looking for notifications in your facebook / twitter. That’s natural. Embrace it. This is the real
culprit.Lower Attention Span and Multi-taskingOur ability to multitask is a marvelous feature in evolution itself. And we take it for
granted. Why shouldn’t we afterall. We (just) love multitasking. Damn, multitasking itself is so full of being in transcendental
state.Here’s one “good” article on the perils of multitasking.But then. Everything comes with consequences...and you should be able to
embrace them gracefully. You whine about not completing a specific task and keep on doing some random actions that you find them joyous
momentarily.Afterall, you belong to two kinds of people:Serializer vs Parallelizer“Serializers”, as I categorize, are those people who tend
to complete one task at a time. Such people tend to be more cautious about the deadlines and dedication. In fact, one of the better
techniques for being a serializer is:Focus. Focus. Focus. And break.Yes, this is aPomodoro Technique.Know it. Implement it. Serialize it.In
the end, it is fruitful and you tend to learn deeply by learning one task at a time.“Parallelizers”,as I categorize, are just opposite to
serializers. Multitaskers, people with lower attention span, or anything you can call.It’s like distributing your bodily energy on various
tasks. Hence, lesser workdone and such.ButIt’s all about your interests and passion. Just channel your interests on a relatively “right”
track.Learn to embrace rejection. Learn to learn. and never let the flame of being a noob die.Afterall,we are to become what we intend to
with deep passion.
