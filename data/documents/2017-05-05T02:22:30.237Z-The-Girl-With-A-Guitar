The Girl With A GuitarSheUnder the shades of the sun-glass, as I walked down upon the street full of puddles and mind full of chaos
thoughts, my eyes crossed with a girl. The moment which seemed like an eternity passed in a blink of an eye.She. She was tall. Taller than
me. Slim, yet gorgeous.She. She was wearing red t-shirt as if she was the symbol for love.As we crossed our paths in a random moment, she
was holding an elderly (very old man) by the hand, as if she was the light to him. Perhaps, that’s the thing about rest of the generations
who don’t think about their grandparents but she seemed different.She was holding her grandfather as ifshe was tracking a missile headed to
infect everyone with love, with calmness.She was the girl carrying a guitarShe didn’t see me. Neither I saw her perfectly. Our eyes didn’t
see each other. Yet there was something different in her eyes. The sense of calmness as she walked down the road carrying a big black vessel
of enormous wizardry.Such coolness. Such humbleness to her grandfather. And such smile. The impulsive moment that didn’t actually make
sense, filled my heart, my mind full of music which she could play. Or perhaps, she could be playing at that moment in her mind.As I am
sinking deep into the thoughts, I realize that she was the girl I saw a few weeks back, helping her grandmother (I assume). She was calm
back then when she was wearing aPink Floyd'st-shirt.It seemsSometimes a random event, a random moment, a random people breeds emotions full
of familiarity. Aseconds-momentseems an eternity onto which the sense of calmness and love thrive. And you feel alive more.
