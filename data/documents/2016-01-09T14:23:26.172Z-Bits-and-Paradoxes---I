Bits and Paradoxes - I“1110100010101”Bits...Ahhh. Those enchantment to ears.On reading the line, you may probably be trying to convert those
freaking binary digits to get a glimpse of an un-encoded information which is just a piece of junk I have put to show off some bits. Yay,
kudos to me! This might be the same old Bliss.Programming background or not you came from, what is important is your core thoughts and
interest on this field. I may not be the one who forced you to join this realm and read this article. But, sure! satisfaction is happiness.
I am writing this one (may be boring to you, but this is what my inner thoughts closely resemble on the things I like to read, feel and do)
and I may not be the person who is correct in these matters. ComplexityJust like a usual life with ups and downs, programming has the same
philosophy. The algorithmic complexity is more simple than the life itself. So, don’t ever feel demotivated when you can’t solve things (or
sort out those things in both ways). Those enchanting moments when you write a first working “hello hello ! knock knock” program might get
you boosted, but that will just be a mere illusion that might hurt you some time later in your life.There is no algorithm to your life but
you will surely try to code that same oldConway’s Game of Lifein order to make you a so-called creator of your own world. Indeed when you
automate a handful of codes and start adding things you like to the programs and codes you are doing, you will always feel like a
GoddamnCreator.Those neat programs you will / have written during your freshmen year (1st-2nd sems -mess), has the potential to burn your
desire to do some great things during your life as a programmer, but there are still 3 years to go and you’ll never know what changes you
can endure.The thing aboutEnduranceis that it is aparadox. You can never really know what a life can endure until you have tried exposing
everything to it and yet people talk about things you can endure. And programming is full of such endurance and thus full of
contradictions.You’ll probably try to do some copy-paste magic to complete your lab works, assignments and try some neat tricks for code
works, but you’ll eventually realize this will not work and will never ever , freakishly ever work in later part of your life. If you can
pass this stage safely using your own mind, and your own skills I am sure that you will , perhaps, be able to reduce the complexity of your
life later. I am not telling you tostopcopy paste. As a programmer, you should never stop on that. Especially with the bug fixes, workaround
and solution scattered across the depth ofstack-overflowand such. And my friend! assembling those stuffs is a work ofartistand you are an
artist of your life.well, that can at least reduce the complexity in your life. However that may just be an illusion. :)[part 2 -> some time
later :) ]
