The Cafe Journal — The Sky Cafe22 July, 2017, Saturday — Boudha, KathmanduPreludeWe bunch of guys — me, Mahendra, Bijay and his friends
(now, my friends) were feeling hungry after the First Kathmandu Quora Meetup.Some of us didn’t have anything for breakfast because of the
early meetup settings.InterludeWe were wandering like bunch of cannibals near the Boudha Stupa. All we had in our mind was to go for this
cafe thatVMAG Hunger Hunthad hunted down. After wandering like zombies we pin-pointed the location. Basically, it was like our own version
of Food Hunt but with a stomach eager to try out “Big Sized Momo”.PostludeThe place is homely. Nothing fancy about the building because it’s
a residential home and probably the home business.For me, the place was love at first sight. Open environment near the gate where lies the
bar or some private Japanese like rooms where lie the tables.The cabins give you the vibes of Japanese house — the low height tables, the
chairless floor, the smirky mats. It’s like you are inside some kind of Japanese restaurant. The lights hanging from the ceiling — they are
aesthetic. But we didn’t sit like a Japanese.The openness of the private chambers gives way for cool breezes. You can get hypnotized by
looking at the curtains sway with harmony. It’s so mesmerizing. Other than that, the outside noises are visible.FoodThe menu has varieties.
Most of them are Tibetian dishes — Laphing, Thendruk, Ramen and yes momo.On our list:Poje Momo(I don’t know how it is spelled :D)These are
momo but each plate is served with 4 large sized dumplings with stuffing according to your choice : veg, chicken, buff.Poser :PFor me, the
momo were oily with unfiltered fat oil coming out from the dumpling as I ate.So, be sure to squeeze the life out of those dumplings if you
don’t like too much of oily stuff.ThendrukThese are like crossbreeds of Laphing and Chowmein. With thick and flat noodles like stripes (I
don’t know how I can describe it).It was good.For me, it was good. I found the spiciness of thechatniquite delicious.PriceThe price blew our
mind — freakingRs 1700. For:Chicken Poje Momo — 3 platesChicken Thendruk Fried — 2 platesFanta — 2Coca Cola — 4It was more than we had
expected.But it’s inevitable provided the environment and many people looking likeso called high-class folkswere there. And the residential
nature of the area itself might have upped the price I suppose.My thoughtsNot a place to hang around often.Once in a while —Hmm. Sounds
cool.But I won’t go back there unless someone sponsors me.There weren’t any background music which was a disappointment for me.Perhaps if I
were the owner, I could make use of some calming music. May be something out from anime I watch. Or something that you hear near Boudha.
