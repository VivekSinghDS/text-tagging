Paradox of My Life Here I am, sitting and watchingAs I peek into the time tickingAll that is gone has never beenAll that has gone is never
seenAnd the plot is on with this humAnd I know I will be gone.....In this wicked land of make-believeIs it only about me?Are my thoughts
cheap?Am I trapped in an eternity of condemnation?Or just a self-exposed contradiction?The paradoxes of thoughts?Or the thoughts of a
paradox?Yes,I guess I am a paradox.Paradox is me.All I can do is watch and sitDunno where I’m going, what it’ll beAs if the wickedness
insideHas the audacity to defy itTo defy the salvation beneathWhere my soul wait to be bleachedAnd all I can do is...Just watch and
sit...Just watch and sit...Yes! My friend!Or should I call you a FOE?You are me and I am youBoth entangled in an oddly shaped
world,Wandering thoughtlessly like a zombieInside the world where you and I collide.Where we grindOur hopes, our dreamsIn the place of make-
believe.And yes!I have brought it upon meWhere we aren’t set freeYes, my friendYou are rightYou are me and I am youWith the mockery in the
thoughtsAnd the heavy inertial plotsIt is my shadow lurking beneathAs I watch the time tickingMy shadow stands therePeeking. Searching.
Wanting.With stealth vision of slaughterA deep conscious murderMy thoughts and my shadow conflictHere and now, there and thenThese are
inside meAnd I am inside themWhat is this world?Where is my place?I stand — lost in thoughtsI am lost — in the mist of lifeRunning.
Hiding.Hush...There comes a sudden whisperA loud breeze passing byThere comes the soundWimperingAhhhh....The lingering sound of silence.The
panicking sound of my own shadow.Yes, you are rightI cant hide...Is there any place to hide?Or is it my illusionTo be bounded hereTrying to
be freeWith an absolute state of mindFalling into a bottomless pitInto a never-ending cycle of hope and despair.In the world where time
mocks you.In this world shaped like a doughnut.Where you and I meet.Where me and my shadow reside.Trapped inside each other.My shadow feeds
needlessly upon the darknessLike cannibals hunting down their own kind.My thoughts sip through my mindLike a parasite eating me from
inside.As darkness dances in its eternal gloryMy life pulsates, radiates into the unknownLike a water leaking through the cracksUnknown of
its shape.Sssh...Remain silent.Can you hear it?Ssssh...Can you hear it?Just listen to it...Sssh...That’s the sound of time passing by.Remain
silent.And enjoy the rhythms of life.Finally, I can hide.The shadow is gone.The sound is no more.And the ending is seamless.Now I know.Oh my
thoughts.Oh my vision.Oh my dream.You are all my FRIENDYou are all my FOE
