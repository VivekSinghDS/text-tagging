Tetris Effect : Beats, Rhythms and MusicHave you ever been obsessed with certain things that you constantly see those things everywhere,
everytime?Have you ever been indulged with ideas, thoughts and actions that you tend to think and act on them constantly?The moment you wake
up and try to have your usual routines, have you been distracted by those mysterous yet superfluous enchantments that’s regressively
diverting your focus from your normal tasks?Whenever, wherever you go, be it to your office, college, home or any other abstract place you
can think of, you might have been diverted to this constant notion that’s stuck in your head like an eternal demigod whispering into your
ears.You might have been playing some awesome games, and then you are stuck in a situation where the real life entities might just be the
part of the game you have been playing and you try to visualize those abstract entities in terms of those games.It’s not just the matter of
those games that have sneaked into your mind like a parasite that’s been eating you inside out; like those mathematics and physics’ puzzles
that’re constantly trying to get hold of your delusioned focus and you’ve got nothing to waver but to face them, battle them and test your
endurance of diversion.Yup, we all have that overly tempting serenade that seems to trap your mind and you just can’t escape from it easily.
At least that’s been the case with me these years (1 year+ i would say). I have been hearing beats and rhythms (not that usual rhythm you
tend to hear from guitar). I have been grinding my teeth for beats that my mind has been generating everytime some silences try to bore me.
Like that silent metronome that has been ticking like forever. I have been diverted by the beats I tend to think and hear. And I just can’t
control my feet, finger or any pen I am holding and can’t just stop them from tapping to the natural beat and rhythm that my mind’s been
playing. It feels as if the beats, tempo and rhythms are just driving me crazy. But luckily I play guitar (and drums, kind of :/) .It always
happens me these days that when I am all alone, bored by silence or some crazy teacher whose talkings I could really never grasp, that I
tend to tap my feet, finger or some pen/pencils; tapping to the beat and rhythm that my mind autonomously generates. Perhaps my mind has
adopted to me not being patience and this might be the reason I can never really stop the thoughts of beats and ticks. But, I wish this was
the core reason, but it is not.You see. I have been highly fascinated by music, beats and rhythms from my very early days I had started to
get into music. I started playing guitar to just kill my boredeom from usualy nerdy, geeky stuffs such as physics and mathematics, and above
all to try to cool my mind. I didn’t really grasp the concept of being engulfed by musical feelings and punk-rock was the only thing i
listened at that time and bands likeGreen Day,Blink 182,Sum 41,etc were the inspiration for me to pick the guitar. And then I suck. I sucked
really hard. I was probably the best sucker there. I used to effing mess up the timings, beats and natural ticks of the music. I was pretty
desparate to learn guitar. I eventually did and was just like thoseRote Learningwhich I had forcefully fed my mind creating the illusion of
feeling the music.But, things started to change few years back. I had started to feel the natural tick of music and it seems my mind has
adopted to those ticks and beats. I had started to feel the natural rhythm in almost everything. Be it the sound of people walking, falling
of rain, be it from the sound of brushing my teeth to vehicles horn, I had started to feel the rhythm of nature. It still feels that I have
gone crazy because the moment I start to be isolated (socially or anything-ly) my brain just goes crazy enough to try to correlate some beat
patterns in almost anything (from ear touching sounds to freaking noises in the crowd). This might be due to my own doings because I was so
desparate to get my timings correct for my guitar play that I had started to over think the melody and beats everytime then and now. This
might just be what it’s calledTetris Effect; the effect seems to be the core reason I am hearing the whispering of beats, rhythms and the
ticks.Perhaps I was desparate at those messed up time that I had started to practice even harder to be good at my instrument, not messing of
the jamming with my friends and getting the timings correct. Now, my whole body and mind strives for those beats and rhythms like those porn
that people watch (or tend to watch). From the moment I wake up to going to bed I tend to hear the beats and rhythms if I try to relax. Even
during my meditation time, I used to be diverted by my own non-casual thinkings of beats and rhythms. And then meditation is what has calmed
me down this time. I have trasferred those negative aspects of tetris effect to something that has made me addicted to beat and rhythm porn.
These days, I am highly addicted to bass. Afterall every bass frequency makes your mind calm and I can really relax during meditation. The
reason I am now sensitive to beats might be this power I have embraced within myself and I can really tap into my inner beats and
ticks.Chronoception,the time perception is another aspect of the tetris effect I have been experiencing. I can really start to tap in my
mind (or just tap my feet or grind my teeth) and tell somewhat how much time has elasped. No, this is not a biological clock, neither I have
some inter dimensional goofy power to tap into the space-time fabric. It’s just my twisted mind that has adopted to complex psychological
aspect of me being obsessed with beats, ticks and rhythms.Most of the time this particular disorder of my mind has been helpful for me in my
music field and killing the boredom. But, sometimes it just drives me crazy and feels like some demigod is really hammering inside my brain,
trying to pluck my brain out of my head. It seriously feels annoying at that time. But, hey, I can’t stop this mental disorder and all I can
do is calm down, do some meditation or just engage myself to some programming stuffs.And again, not to mention that I tend to sync and tap
with the beats of keyboard as I type and tap into the codeless code I tend to write.It might be just like that seemingly unharmful rubber-
band that is stretched to full potential and may catapult anytime. -_-
