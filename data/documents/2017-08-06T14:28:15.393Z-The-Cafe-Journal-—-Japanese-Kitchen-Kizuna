The Cafe Journal — Japanese Kitchen Kizuna04 August, 2017, FridayPreludeAfter tedious hours of programming and getting things done, the trio
— Me, Bijay and Mahendra left the office 15 minutes early in search of a great cafe where we can relieve our stress and talk about the
things we talk daily — work, life, love and shit. And this time we were eager to try something Japanese.InterludeNothing much this time.
Just same old lonely path to Thamel. We knew the place we were headed was somewhere near to the cafe we had visited last time (The Cafe With
No Name).That’s it. Google map did point us to the location. But again, we were confused. The place wasso near, yet so far.PostludeThe place
is located inside this alleyway that leads to an awesome open space. The alley itself is surreal — filled with these statues, masks and all
the cool memento (that probably represent the Nepalese culture) you can get for your closed ones.AlleywayThe Open SpaceAt first glance you
might think the place is congested. But don’t get fooled. The open space feels like a hyperbolic time chamber like in Dragon Ball Z (anime).
Inside are many restaurants, bars and cafe that give you the vibes of Japanese/Korean streets.The open space. (My friend Mahendra is such a
poser. :D)The open space gave me a sensation ofWOW.Kizuna — The Japanese KitchenThe kitchen didn’t match our expectation. We had some kind
of large cafe in our mind. Then, we realized the very essence ofKizunameaningbondbecause outside lie many benches where you can sit, relax
and bond with the people you go with. Talk about anything.The sensation is calming under the green roof that’s being mounted up. The place
is good for dating too where you can sit for hours and still never run out of the words and thoughts. Remember it’s not a private space
though.The Roof : See those eyes, curve and beauty. It’s mesmerizingSurrounding cafe/bar/hotel/restaurant are there, each with their own
theme and music playing in the background, the juxtaposition of which create a calming sensationFoodAs expected the dishes are all Japanese.
Most of the names can directly be referenced by some kind of anime I have watched, especiallyKatsudon(you should hear Bijay say the name in
an amazing way.Katsudon... Roar...).Bijay and the Katsudon impression. :DWe ordered:Katsudon with Chicken ToppingIt is a bowl of rice topped
with deep-fried chicken. You can have other toppings too. But hey, we all like chickens right?Along with a bowl of rice comes this
particular soup that really makes your tongue itchy. I don’t know if it’s just me feeling that itch.The chicken is just an ordinary one.
What is intriguing is the Japanese’s way of having rice. The rice is thick, the type that you make porridge (Kheer). Unlike we Nepalese
having the food style of rice mixed with some kind of curry eaten with a hand, the Japanese rice are eaten with chopsticks. So, we did
struggle having the rice.Nevertheless the fried chicken + rice combo is delicious. But I can’t say same for the soup that’s tagged
along.Tempura (The Prawn)Tempura is actually a classical Portuguese dish brought to and popularized by Japan, consisting of seafood or
vegetables that have been battered and deep fried. We had ordered the prawn version.We Nepalese might know the prawn as the crispy chip
which is fried in the oil. But the prawn is a sea animal covered with hard exo-skeleton and soft on the inside.My (our) first sea food and
it’s awesome.PrawnThe meat of prawn is soft and spongy. For me, it tasted better than same old chicken.The plate Kizuna serves contains
deep-fried prawn meat along with some deep-fried crispy vegetables.Overall, the food is delicious and healthy. Not so oily, yet
crispy.PriceThe price turned out to be not so expensive like other cafe we had been in the past. Provided the quantity (which was able to
fill 3 hungry stomach), the price was affordable — Rs 760.Chicken Katsudon — Rs 300Tempura — prown — Rs 280Cold Drinks — Rs 150, Rs 50
eachMineral Water — Rs 30Yes, it’s cheap. So, thumbs up for quality, quantity and the price.My ThoughtsAwesome place to try Japanese food.
Cheap and qualitative.Great place to hang around in the evening with open environment.Above all, falls under medium budget when it comes to
having foreign dish.No! You won’t find live music there in the evening but the feeling is different when sun goes away and the lights start
to float around.Snapshot from the side of Kizuna Kitchen. Kizuna is not visible in the picture. PS: Next time going for Korean as suggested
by one of my friends who love Japanese food.
