Dear Love... Hey!Love.Where are you?Are you still in your mother’s womb?Or taking a nap on her lap?What are you doing?Are you playing with
your father?Or is he watching your first stutter? Where are you, really? Oh dear,Love.I know you are right here.Or perhaps, down the street.
Right there.Helping that old lady cross the road.Or giving to the homeless, your old clothesAre you in your friend’s house doing
homeworks?Or just having chit chat about your crush.Are you in the streets playing with your friends?Or making love with yourself watching
the porns?Where are you, really?I am desperate to know. Oh dearLove!I know you are around.Pranking with your sister.Or playing video games
with your brother.I know you are around.Where are you?Are you playing in that puddle of mud?Or teasing that dog down the street?I know it. I
have seen it.You just stole those dollars for a candy or two.Or perhaps, buying roses without any clue. Oh love! Don’t be cruel.Stop hitting
your child without any reasons.I know it hurts.It saddens.It pains.But yes,Love! Hang in there.Hope is alive and so are you. Oh
dearLove!Don’t feel sad.I know she has just passed away.I don’t know the pain.But that’s where you thrive.Where you had felt alive.Hang in
there.Keep on flourishing. Oh dearLove!I know that feelingWhen you give vision to the visionlessEmotions to the emotionlessLife to the
lifeless.HeyLove! Just smile.Smile is salvation.Never stop it.You are fit.The world knows that. Finally...DearLove!I have found you.I have
reasons to live.I salute you.And yes.I have gained courage to accept you.
