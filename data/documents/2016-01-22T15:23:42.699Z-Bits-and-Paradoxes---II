Bits and Paradoxes - IIProgramming is an artA food for thought to you.“programming vs coding”“programmers vs coders”Go on. Debate with your
friends. Debate with your seniors. Debate with you juniors. Debate with your life on the line and don’t hesitate to debate. Just debate, so
that you can clear your mind or mind of other people.As for the topic of that debate, I considerprogrammingas a superior act of simulation
of thoughts. Whilecodingis just an act of following a set of instructions, rules and implementation, programming is what thinks, creates,
discusses, verifies, solves and again thinks. Coders are the experts on programming language while programmers are the supreme artist that
goes to the depth of the problem, analyze the seeds and know how to grow that seed, what can distract that growth and how those seeds get
life to solve problems.As I have written my view in my blogcodingparadox.heroku.com:Programming is more than just elegant code. It’s where
your mind meets imagination.To be able to fill up the void canvas with not just paints but efficient imagination.And imagination becomes
efficient when you live up to realize your dreams.“Dreams! you say!” is nothing but the way a pessimist longs to see the sparks in an
eternal darkness“My friend” this is what I believe when I automate an entry of codes with handful of skills and boundless imaginationThat’s
where programming differs from coding. Programming is an art while coding is just a sweet-smelling fart.Think of coders as those software
engineers that are puppet-ed by the puppeteers, chained by strings of “do this, do that” and of programmers as the free thinker.One of my
friends think of programmers and coders as hierarchical entities. He considers programmers as one level higher coder.In some way this just
points that programmers and coders do definitely differ in terms of skills.And I agree with his view too.So, this debate is open. Everyone
has their opinion. But you cannot deny the fact that there exists differences in“to build”and“to create”and that’s what I have to say.So, as
a programmer (that I consider myself based on what I do, and for this you can call me arrogant enough). you shouldn’t hesitate to build. You
shouldn’t, in fact, hesitate to implement your ideas on a miniature scale. In fact, to create you should build.In programming every idea is
worth and implementation is even greater.I will point to another quote that my friend says“No matter what an idea is, implementation is that
counts”.Yup, I am in a total agreement with this view because I have same views as“concept is global, implementation is egocentric”.No
matter what your ideas are, don’t ever hesitate to implement it; be it in the educational project for which you write proposals or just some
side projects that you tend to build.There are many examples of such side projects which later turned out to be pretty awesome, amazingly
amazing and good enough to the world.You can’t really know the outcome until you have tried it yourself.After all, everyone is addicted to
ideas and thoughts.
