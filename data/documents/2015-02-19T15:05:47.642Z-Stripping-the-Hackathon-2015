Stripping the Hackathon-2015“hmm... this idea seems good and convincing” ...As these words echoed through our intense discussion session
before registration, we were indeed convinced that we were creating something new.And while eternal silence was broken, form was posted
(mouse clicked) and we were smiling.Yes, this was the situation during the day just before the 3-day event of Hackathon-2015. I (we) was
very much excited because it was my first time experiencing such event in my life. Our team,THE LUCIFERS,means “morning star” seemed to be
taking its first test flight and the our applicationKarmathalomight be something we had thought.Seeking out the codes within our minds and
the UI within the limits of the paper we had, we were indeed anxious, nervous (may be only i was nervous) as first-time panic attack because
most of the ideas of other groups were indeed awesome and something new.Coding was the hard part : we didn’t know where to start. and then
there were weBRAINWASHEDYes, you read it right we wereBRAINWASHED, minds went blank and the storm that we caught up was something that
disappointed and appointed us simultaneously like a surfer that saw a wave in the vastness which turned out to be tsunami.By end of day
second , our ideas mutated into something that lost its identity likeShip of Theseus.The neurons were tormented as the mentor spat all those
awesome suggestions and their thoughts about our concept (yes it later turned into broken egg) and what was lacking was our approach to the
problem cuz we never quite approached it seriously (not to mention the waste of the inks and backspaces :D).Basically, all that gave quite
never saved. Not a single line of code and we were in a situation where a snake eats ittself;poof: idea went NULL and our flight
stalled.Bingo we hit the lackpot (yes lackpot not jackpot) as we lacked something calledResearchand quite not complete an ideal application
‘karmthalo’ not to mention all flooded by tsunami and we stood third ; third from last (:D)test flight was a failureWe were not even
questioned during our presentation (well 2 questions dont count as we were the very first ones for the presentation and all was quite and
quiteness wasNULL)Apparently, the hackathon taught some things to me:1) learn to learn the problem you are trying to solve2) present
yourself idiotically cool3) and remember you are part of a team4) code and create an application overnight :PNot to mention : ‘i never
mentioned what our idea was’(Nevermind that part)Be chill, a win for an experience(yay) and have your mind say (what an affine LOL writings
) and yes my handwriting is worse than this.
