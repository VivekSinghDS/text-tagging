Knowledge and Wisdom,as I see.“Knowledge is power”, as they say.As the human civilization soar high through the unknown passage of time,
knowledge has been the essence in every life. Knowledge is the information and we human thrive for information; not to smooth-out our whole
life, but to find pleasure and happiness.Human beings rise on the giant shoulder of the knowledge that has been passed down from
generations, so that the future won’t live like dead. The very books, scrolls, papers, that has powered the information pool of today is the
key that our source of knowledge is enriched and well lived.Gathering knowledge is good enough to make one’s life. However being “wise” is
more than simply having knowledge. It is one thing to memorize the books and facts. However it is the wise thing to use those knowledge to
drive the forces for betterment. Boxing up concept is good enough , but ability to think outside the box is greater.(as In the passage by
Bertrand Russell) The very example of nuclear outbreak is enough to make us realize the boundaries where knowledge and wisdom get separated
as two entities. The creation of nuclear energy is from knowledge. However had mankind been wise enough, the atomic bombing would not be
alive in the history books we read today.The very core of every civilization may be the knowledge that powers it. However, it is the wisest
words earned through experience of life and death that could have made humans a boon to nature.You may know how to propose a girl (that’s
knowledge). However it is the wisdom to find “true love and happiness”. He who refines the knowledge can seek the wisdom that was not
sought. A person that has learnt the way of life and time may have wisdom because he/she has stood up from the mistakes that had been
committed in the life. “Knowledge is power, wisdom is light”, as I say.We humans have developed and advanced so much through the knowledge
that has been passed down from generation to generation, we are more informative and knowledgeable today than the people were in the past.
The sole reason is “tons” of information that we have today. Be it from Sir Isaac Newton, Leonardo Da Vinci, Aristotle to Sigmund Freud to
thatprofessorwho teaches in your class.I don’t mean to wipe out their legacy, hereWell, they are all knowledgeable, informative and can make
you understand the concept of so-called world. You may have better information from the information-pool of tons of books and the internet
of lies, there are few in million who are wise enough.People in the past were muchWISERthan that of today. And it is not the matter of
simplicity that defines the wisdom, it is much complex that ought to be. Life, death, self-awareness, experience, feelings, sense of
priority, comprehensiveness, are all that summed up to refine a centered-knowledge into the wiser information for wisdom. We may have
progressed in science, technology, health,etc through the infinite knowledge-pool we have today but we do not know much about how to teach
wisdom. In the course of time, the wiser words had been abandoned in favour of personal or community improvements. Those awesome people of
the past who learnt the hard way through struggle , experiences were wise enough to give you “revival” potion for your life, for humanity
and mankind.Just as a growing child senses the world through a mere physical form, gradually gains the hold of the world outside, it is the
wisdom that teaches that child to act in thepuppeted-worldto have aself-esteemand toloveothers;world-centeredknowledge he/she gains and
gradually gains wisdom.that is wisdom, an evolved knowledge; gained selfishly or selflessly
