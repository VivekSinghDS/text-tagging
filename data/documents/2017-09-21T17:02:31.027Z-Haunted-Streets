Haunted Streets Walking — calmly and slowlyLetting go of all the hustleAimlessly kissingThe time and the street beneathWhere lies pain and
miseryOf life among the historyA step I take“Tak Tak”— the sound of the cityI see people lurkingWith greed and lustWhere hopes are
crushedBehind the mask of trust As the gentle breeze passes byAll I can hear is “money”Where life rumbles in agonyNot of sufferingBut the
voices — all suppressedAnd “People” inside a soul-less thingWith all the corruptionWithin the lifeless emotionsSome lives livingSome
starting to liveSome struggling and stumbling As I wander, oftenSomething follows me behindNot a shadow but a timeless beingAmong the silent
noisesThat fill the streetsWith hopes and despairWith trust and careWith living and the deadWith “rights” and ritualsWith face and curious
minds Walking, running, crawlingAs I feel the screamsOf survival dreamsOn these streetsWhere people laughAnd hatred thrivesWhere poor napA
child without mother’s lapWhere children playAnd diseased layWhere money talksWith the curseOf a soulLiving in fear As I wake upOn the
streetsWhere darknessUpholds the lightLife speaksTime liesPatience fallsEndurance poisonsThe streets beneathHaunted byme
