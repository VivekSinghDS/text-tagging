New Year X BSWe have entered into yet another year in our native calendar. Happy new yearX BSto all of you. May it render awesome moments,
again.Talking about new years, I don’t feel much excited about it these days. I dunno the real reason for that. Perhaps it’s on the line
that I am growing up. And nostalgia hitting you really hard like remembering all the stuffs from childhood. You all remember right? Those
fun and happy moments when you get a new year holiday and are all excited about going out with your family.Eager to join new class, making
new friends and reading stories from new books. These all used to pump up fun and excitement. And yes, the best part was selling old books
and copies to recycling-men just to get few rupees.Now, as I am growing up, it’s a different kind of excitement. It’s more like a thrill for
upcoming days full of adventures and risks and what lies ahead.The best part of new year is seeing people bring out their resolutions only
during first few days. Well! That’s quite depressing. Because people fail to resolve their own vows. For me, resolutions are distractions
that keep you motivated for few days/weeks. Because I can always start something anew anytime. I know I have to improve upon my current self
every now and then. That’s why the goal is to have just a KISS.Keep It Simple Stupid.Learn. Share. Smile.Cheers. Be awesome. Stay awesome.
