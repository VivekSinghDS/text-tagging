When Nature Calls... Those empty walls, the noiseless air, the soundless birds, the barking dogs, the crowded streets, the chattering
humans, the unnatural sun, the made-up clouds, the wandering thoughts.We are chained to these. It is our own artificial fate because there’s
no escape from this urban reality we have carved, we have delved deeper into. Leaving the monotonous urban lifestyle is hard, especially
when you are living apipe dream— hopes tangling by a thread like the sword of damocles. And it takes mere willpower and an extra timeless
space just to break out of this matrix.Whenever I get a chance to break things in my life, I break my own life. I break myself, I break my
daily lifeless routine. I roam around the streets where dogs are the kings. The dog fights, ant mashups, struggling birds, honking wheelers,
above all humanless faces strike my ever increasing thoughts.And whenever I get to escape this reality towards mother nature, I feel
transcended like an astral projection where I get to know myself more. It’s when the nature calls my name in a silent breeze that I really
feel alive.When nature callsI levitate towards the bank of a river. It’s like the river is calling my name and I can’t really help but to
get acquainted at the shore like a mindless zombie wandering without reason. Yes, the river really calls my name as I sit quietly listening
all the hustle, the screaming of time.When nature callsI lay on the ground and pay my respect to the mighty blue sky for its vastness that
has seen millennia of love, hatred, war and peace. My mind wanders without thoughts. It’s when I realize the great Skypiea floating under
the command of the mighty sky where sun plays hide and seek.When nature callsI close my eyes and listen to the music that has been played
for eternity. The chirping, the croaking, the breeze — all has been playing their own musical instrument to please their mother, the mother
nature; where I am just an insignificant being with lifeless life. Like a circus monkey that’s been tamed to perform against its willpower.
Yes, nature really calls me, calls my name.When nature callsDon’t call me. Don’t search me. Don’t think about me.You don’t have to.For I am
into the nature. The nature is onto me.And just like that I’ll be gone.
