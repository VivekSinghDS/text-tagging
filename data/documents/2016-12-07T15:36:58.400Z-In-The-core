In The core Why’s it always in the core?For the freedom of a boreThat tore the system apartMaking everyone the slaves.It had to be with the
sodomized rulesThat governed the entire pulseUnwillingly seeding into the breathWhy is it just in the core?Why? everyone wondersThe vicinity
of the enslavedWhy, why in the core?They f**ked with ur mindThey hung your neckThey took your breathNow, they are resurrecting your
deathWHY?They made the system, Framed the majorityNow they are puppeting...They are who they areIn this age of dark terrorWhy’s it always in
the core?They led the truth of lies into the deadThe resurrection has been fedSo, now what?The silence of the answer remains..Why???They
f**ked with the your mindThey hanged your neckThey took your breathNow, they are resurrecting your deathWhy??Now, just go on and live the
death of lifeBe ressurrected and be cursed
