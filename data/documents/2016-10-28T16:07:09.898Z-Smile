SmileSmile is a maskShe feels the pain, she feels the gain. In the sorrow she locks herself up with the grief nobody really understands;
nobody cares to understand. Yet, she astounds the world with her serene makeup of pseudo-happiness.She masks her feelings with asmile.A
smile that locks up the world in inspiration.A smile that the world doesn’t care to devle deeper to understand.A smile — a heavenly smile
upon which the joy, sorrow, mischief, laughter, tears, get mixed down upon the horizon of aspiration.Smile is a connectionShe talks with her
family, her friends. She talks with the people around. She talks; she connects mentally. Above all, she talks with her inner self.In
sadness, in happiness — she connects with people pondering about depths of life. Like a moonlight that shines upon the blissful pavement
where upon the shadows dance gracefully — the connection between the light and the shadows to showcase a synergy.That’s why hersmilebrings a
transcendental connection to everyone.Sometimes, she feels rage; she feels caged. Yet, she doesn’t cease to smile.A smile that brings joy to
the sad ones.A smile that wipes up the tears.A smile — a blessing to the near ones, to the dear ones.But...In her agony, world laughs at
her.In her sadness, the world mocks her situation.In her presence, when she smiles, the world fakes a laugh.Yes! Like people that eats
people mentally, the world ignores her smile.A smile that does magic beyond the rhythms of her voice, her words.A smile that tries to
eradicate the internal conflict — existential crisis.Yet...Her smile has left deeper scar in my heart, in my soul. For she’s the only smile
that’s left inside of me.PS: It’s about my mother. The struggle she (and we) had been through at one point in our life.
